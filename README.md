# Click-to-Bounce-Ball
Canvas Element: The project begins by setting up an HTML canvas element. This canvas serves as the playing area where the game's visuals are rendered.

Interactive Ball: A ball is placed on the canvas, representing the game's main character. This ball can be clicked to make it move.

Mouse Click Event: The game features a mouse click event listener that allows players to control the ball's movement. When the user clicks anywhere on the canvas, the ball responds by moving towards the clicked location.

Boundary Bouncing: To add a challenge, the ball bounces off the canvas boundaries when it reaches them. This creates an engaging gameplay experience.

JavaScript Logic: The project is driven by JavaScript code that handles the ball's movement, collision detection, and bounce counting. The JavaScript code calculates the direction in which the ball should move and updates its position accordingly.

Bounce Counter: The game keeps track of the number of times the ball bounces off the canvas boundaries, and this count is displayed on the canvas.

Reset Button: To provide additional user interaction, a "Reset" button is included. Clicking this button resets the bounce count and repositions the ball at the center of the canvas.

Styling with CSS: The game's visual appeal is enhanced through CSS, which defines the layout, colors, and positioning of the canvas and reset button.
